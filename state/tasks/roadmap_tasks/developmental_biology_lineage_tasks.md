## 📋 **Plan Overview**

The developmental biology component addresses the complete implementation of lineage-tagged neuroepithelial cell generation for downstream proliferation during embryonic neural tube development. This builds directly on the completed foundation layer (morphogen gradients, ventricular system, meninges scaffold) to create the cellular basis for neurogenesis.

**Integration Point**: Uses completed foundation layer morphogen gradients to drive cell fate specification and lineage tagging for future neuronal differentiation.

> **Validation 2025-01-30** – End-to-end validation: accuracy 0.705 (status: ACCEPTABLE). Integration score: 1.00. Calibrations: stage-aware spatial scaling, stage-specific cycle lengths, SHH/BMP/WNT/FGF gradient matching, spatial reweighting (thickness prioritized).
> **Enhancement 2025-01-30** – Added RA/FGF8 gradients, apoptosis modeling, phase-dependent INM velocity, Notch oscillation. Architecture compliance: split oversized modules, all files ≤300 LOC.

## 🔴 **CRITICAL VALIDATION ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **Major Problems Found During Validation**

1. **🔴 Unverified Experimental Data Sources**
   - Multiple citations to papers that could not be verified (Calegari & Huttner 2005, Bocanegra-Moreno et al. 2023, Delás et al. 2022, etc.)
   - Code contains explicit placeholder comments: "PLACEHOLDER - needs real data from published papers"
   - Web searches failed to find evidence of these specific papers containing the claimed quantitative data

2. **🔴 No Actual Test Results for KPIs**
   - Claims of achieving `lineage_tracking_accuracy` ≥ 95% with no supporting test data
   - Claims of `cell_count_variance` ≤ 5% with no actual measurements found
   - Claims of `proliferation_rate_match` ≥ 90% with no validation results
   - Claims of `division_pattern_ratio` = 60:40 with no actual ratio measurements

3. **🔴 Placeholder Data Masquerading as Real Validation**
   - `experimental_data_reference.py` contains explicit comments: "These are placeholder datasets based on literature descriptions"
   - Validation systems reference fake datasets with fabricated values
   - No evidence of actual experimental data integration despite claims

4. **🔴 Module Count Discrepancy**
   - Claims of "92 total modules implemented" but actual count is 106 Python files
   - Inconsistent reporting of implementation status

### **Recommendations**

1. **Obtain Real Experimental Data**: Source actual quantitative data from verified peer-reviewed publications
2. **Implement Actual Validation Tests**: Create real test suites that measure KPIs against actual data
3. **Verify All Citations**: Ensure all referenced papers exist and contain the claimed data
4. **Remove Placeholder Claims**: Replace all placeholder data with real experimental data or mark as incomplete

**🔴 SYSTEM STATUS: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION - REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL VALIDATION WORK**
